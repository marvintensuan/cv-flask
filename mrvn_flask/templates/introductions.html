    <h1>Introductions</h1>
    <p>
      Introductions are hard. Like, what part of you do you want to share with other people? Is it even shareable?
      Who even is interested? Are they interested? Who knows? Here is an HTML page for mine.
    </p>
    <h2>Hi!, I'm Marvin</h2>
    <p>
      I was born in 1997. That's pretty much the current year + 3.
      You're only gonna be wrong 24 days a year, or if you're past the year 2099. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stuff here are meant to spark conversations, not replace them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, did you catch my surname? Do you think it's a Pinoy surname or do you just not mind?
      Regardless, to set everyone's expectations, <span lang="zh-Hans">Êàë‰∏ç‰ºöËØ¥‰∏≠Êñá„ÄÇ</span>
    </p>
    <h2>FORD</h2>
    <h3>Family</h3>
    <p>Let's not.</p>
    <p>I'm single tho.</p>
    <h3>Occupation</h3>
    <p>
      I am a... BS Accountancy graduate.
      3 years at Deutsche Bank. Almost 2 years at Citi. Currently at ANZ Bank.
      I have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marvintensuan/">LinkedIn</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Recreation</h3>
    <p>What recreation? Jk.</p>
    <h3>Dreams</h3>
    <p>This site has a <a href="/lifegoals">lifegoals</a> page</p>
    <h2>Tech</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, I created this site. It is a Flask app deployed via Google Cloud Run.
      For some reason, I also love writing HTML by hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I will probably not fix your printer.
      But I am willing to disassemble it... often leading to it being fixed.
    </p>
    <h2>Anime</h2>
    <p>
      I do watch anime, but only the mainstream ones. I do not have a MyAnimeList profile
      but here are some of the ones I've watched:
      <details>
        <summary>List of Animes I've Liked</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Dragon Ball Z Kai and Super</li>
          <li>Attack on Titan</li>
          <li>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</li>
          <li>Naruto (without fillers)</li>
          <li>One Punch Man</li>
          <li>Death Note</li>
          <li>Steins;Gate</li>
          <li>Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood</li>
        </ul>
      </details>
    </p>
    <p>I don't remember some of these due to passage of time.</p>
    <p>
      I don't actually watch anime anymore, mainly because I do not have the time.
      I would have been willing to just listen to it at background but
      (1) I also do not have time for that, and (2) I don't understand Japanese.
    </p>
    <h2>Series and TV Shows</h2>
    <p>
      I have watched three sitcoms: Friends, The Big Bang Theory, and Seinfeld. Don't quiz me though.
    </p>
    <p>
      Series I've watched: Game of Thrones (wish I hadn't), Stranger Things, Breaking Bad.
      I do not have Amazon Prime and HBO; don't recommend exclusives.
      Actually, don't recommend at all. I probably do not have the energy.
    </p> 
    <h2>Movies and Movie Franchises</h2>
    <p>I like movie theaters. I do watch alone but I wish I don't have to since CR breaks are hard.</p>
    <p>
      MCU - kinda got invested since Phase 3. I think Infinity War > Endgame but the portals scene
      just takes the cake in terms of rewatchability. I've watched some of the Disney Plus shows as well.
    </p>
    <p>Star Wars - I've watched all trilogies, Rogue One, and Solo. Can't find time to watch the D+ series.</p>
    <h2>Fun facts</h2>
    <p>We had this "Fun Facts About You" which is apparently harder than it sounds.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I cannot whistle.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to ibuprofen.</li>
      <li>That dark thing at the left side of my neck is a skin eruption thing.</li>
    </ul>
